        If you found this, this doesnt exist now. I'm just lazy to add an 404 page
        <br>
        
        <h1 style="font-size:30px;">Why I can't update the home page like how I promised?</h1>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">TLDR:I have no free time</p>
        Normally I told yall that I would update the home page every 2 weeks but there are few reasons that I can't update it.
        <br>
        Reason 1: No free time
        <br>
        I'm now in an time where I have to prepare for an exam and that takes my time. Also my schedule got tighter
        because of the exam.
        <br>
        Reason 2: Boredom
        <br>
        Operating a website looks easy but it is hard. Also I keep forgettng about it so boredom goes to this category
        but it is hard operating a website. Like I am watching a live stream while I'm writing on vscode lol.
        <br>
        Reason 3: Time04
        <br>
        By the time I remember I have different interests like I am into older iPhones now. I bought an iPhone 5 and 4. Website operation is not for me lol.
        <br>
        So that's why I can't update the home page.
